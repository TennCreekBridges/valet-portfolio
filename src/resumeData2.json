In the years that I've been with the company, my role has evolved significantly! I am now responsible for managing our BigCommerce web store account, which includes generating product descriptions, entering product specs, photographing and integrating product hot spots from Wordpress. I develop and  publish web mockups and create company-wide style standards. I also manage our Dealer Portal, which provides critical information for our network of 150+ global dealers. I design product sell sheets for our sales staff to use at shows, and have experience with large-format printing in designing our trade show booth setups. I develop new boat logos using Illustrator, develop instruction manuals for our products in InDesign and point-of-purchase materials for distribution to our dealer network, including neon signs, dealer binders, tin tacker signs, and banners. I develop our soft goods, from t-shirts to hats and create print ads for kayaking publications. Our marketing team collaborates with Asana, Zoom, Slack and Skype, and we are constantly generating and implementing new marketing campaigns."

She was by far the smartest student in the class. She also was the only one who consistently arrived on Rollerblades. Impressed, I recruited her as the call center manager for a statewide public opinion poll I was running, a job she did flawlessly until she graduated in 2009. During my time as her professor and then supervisor, I learned that Bridgett has not only the brains to handle her responsibilities but also the creativity to handle them in a way that will leave you a teeny bit envious of how much fun she is having.",
